    <p>Anakin Skywalker’s rise and fall is a tragic arc defined by brilliance, passion, and vulnerability. Discovered as a slave boy with extraordinary Force potential, he was trained as a Jedi and quickly became one of the Order’s most gifted warriors, celebrated for his courage in the Clone Wars. Yet beneath his heroism grew fear—especially the fear of losing those he loved. Manipulated by Chancellor Palpatine, who exploited Anakin’s insecurities and promised the power to prevent death, he slowly drifted from Jedi ideals. His struggle between loyalty and desire ultimately consumed him, leading to his transformation into Darth Vader. In embracing the dark side, Anakin sought control but lost himself, becoming an instrument of tyranny until his final act of redemption decades later.</p>
